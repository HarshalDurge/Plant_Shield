# Intelligent Sapling Shield: An Autonomous System for Sustainable Plant Care

Description:
Plant health is increasingly threatened by environmental stressors, improper irrigation practices, and animal interference, leading to decreased growth and vitality. Current solutions often fail to integrate autonomous irrigation with effective deterrent mechanisms in a single system. This paper presents the Intelligent Sampling Shield, an innovative device designed to enhance plant protection and optimize growth conditions. The system features an autonomous soil moisture regulation mechanism to optimize water usage, reducing wastage and irrigation costs, while a vibrational deterrent system mitigates animal interference, preventing crop damage. Constructed from plastic mesh, the device ensures proper sunlight exposure, airflow, and shade, with an integrated waterproof LED strip for night-time illumination. Results demonstrate that the system maintains optimal soil moisture levels, reducing water consumption compared to traditional irrigation methods. Additionally, automated plant care minimizes labour requirements, ensuring consistent hydration and protection while enhancing crop resilience and yield. By promoting cost-effective, resource-efficient, and sustainable agricultural practices, the Intelligent Sampling Shield contributes to urban greening initiatives and biodiversity conservation, supporting long-term ecological sustainability.
